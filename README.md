# twichdrone
A proof of concept to integrate various embedded technologies, in order to "replicate" the Twich drone from Rainbow Six Siege. I use Raspberry Pi 3, Arduino, Arduino Motor Shield, Python, HTML and JS.

This project implements a two wheel driven drone, controlled via WiFi with a portable device, using a browser via standard HTML & JS code.

Note that mjpg-streamer is another project (see https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer for details).
