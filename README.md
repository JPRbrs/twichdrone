# twichdrone
A proof of concept to integrate various embedded technologies, in order to "replicate" the Twich drone from Rainbow Six Siege. I use Raspberry Pi 3, Arduino, Arduino Motor Shield, Python, HTML and JS. This project builds a two wheel driven drone, that is managed via HTML browser (e.g. Chrome) from a portable device. See the blog entry for more details.

Note that mjpeg-streamer is a compilation of https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer
